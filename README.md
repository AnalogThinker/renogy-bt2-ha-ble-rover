BRANCH FROM ard00d's amazing work, slightly modified to work on the Rover series (Renogy Rover 20 / 30 / 40)

# Renogy-bt2-ha-ble-rover

A Home Assistant (MQTT) integration for the Renogy BT-2 bluetooth module specifically for Renogy Rover.

Modification includes a modification of the MQQT names and a formula update for Solar/Charging Power Output, so it reflects exactly how the App displays them.

For install and integration into Home Assistant, check ard00d's git
